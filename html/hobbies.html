        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <hr class="head-bar" />

        <p>This is a brief overview of my hobbies.</p>

        <article id="Computers">

          <h2>Computers</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>I got into computers as a hobby in middle school, and it was one of the drivers for my decision to go into computer science. <!--Something about the hands-on natue of troubleshooting software, and the personality of custom computers intrigued me, this has been one of my main hobbies since.--></p>
          <p>Assembling custom computers is one of my favorite (although sometimes frustrating) things to do. The satisfaction of DIY and the troubleshooting knowledge gained are my primary motivators.</p>
          <p id="Desktop">The current revision of my desktop is pictured below. Its goal was to be overkill for what I need, and it most assuredly is for the software I run. Originally built for hobbyist 3D modeling, rendering, and VMs, it has been mostly relegated to homework and the occasional video game.</p>
          
          <figure>

            <figcaption>My main desktop computer (Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB 2666MHz, GTX Titan Xp "2017")</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p id="OldPC">Collecting old computers and their components are another source of enjoyment for me. The stories of where they were found, what they did, and who might have used them are always interesting, and I really do not have a better explanation of why I enjoy it.</p>
          <p>For example, when Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin shut down there was a pile of old electronics that were to be thrown away. In the pile I found an old IBM Model M, a keyboard I had wanted for some time. The only issues were that it was missing the period key cover on the number pad and was filthy. A thorough cleaning later, and it was good as new. Since it came from the observatory, it was interesting to think about what projects it may have been used to type up or telescopes it may have controlled.</p>

          <p id="ThinkPads">Keeping with that theme, one of my favorite laptops is from the IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad line. Currently I have five, with all but one being the Lenovo variety. The only IBM model I have is the X60, but I plan to change that.</p>
          <p>All of them have been used on a daily basis by me at some point. Unfortunately, my X1 Carbon (pictured) that I used throughout high school is finally dying, and it suffers from what I believe is a graphics or a memory problem.</p>

          <h2>Motorcycling</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>By far, one of my favorite outdoor activities is motorcycle riding. The feeling of freedom is like no other. You can take in scenery more fully, and pulling over to admire a view feels more natural. With a completely open cockpit, the speed limit feels fast, and you slow down to enjoy the ride. It is hard to describe, but that makes it no less fun.</p>
          <p>Although not my first pick, I ride a 2004 Harley-Davidson Sportster 883. The price was right, so I couldn't say no, but I do prefer something of either the standard or sportbike variety. Examples being the Yamaha FZ-07 and Yamaha YZF-R6.</p>

          <h2>Skiing</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>When the snow finally falls, my favorite place to be is the ski hill. The discipline I most enjoy is downhill freestyle, and learning new tricks is one of my favorite aspects of the sport.</p>

          <h3 id="Sketching">Sketching</h3>
          
          <p>In my free time, I like to practice sketching. I mostly draw still life, and I am trying to work on blueprint sketches and floor layouts.</p>

          <p>I have always liked the style of watercolor, and I have recently been working to further my skills in the medium.</p>
