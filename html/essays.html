          <h2>The Motorcycling Experience</h2>

          <p>One of the reasons someone buys a convertible is to experience the outside world while driving. Motorcycle riding expands on this. It is an exhilarating experience that allows you to more immersively view the environment and connect to both the road and machine through sounds and feelings.</p>

          <p>At car speeds, you can see the world without obstruction from safety pillars or automotive glass. There are no barriers between you and the environment. The road, which was once but a passing thought, barely a concern, can be seen zipping past your feet only inches away. The cracks and holes in the road are now actively searched for as they can be the difference between a safe ride and a visit to the emergency room. Through the back roads, you can clearly see the beauties of nature. The trees and brush once seen in a picture-like fashion are now clearly visible and closer feeling than ever. Animals near the edge of the road, usually obscured by a door panel while passing by, can be seen scurrying away as you fly past. While appreciating the newfound clarity the ride brings, you also feel the various aspects of the ride.</p>

          <p>The rawness of a motorcycle is hard to beat. Unlike a car, the engine is now centerstage. You can feel its rhythmic thump beneath you telling you how it’s doing and reminding you that it’s still there. Every gear change is felt with a characteristic clunk through your foot and grip of the clutch engaging in your hand. You can feel the tires slip if too hamfisted with the break levers. Through the handlebars, you feel the road like never before. With power steering sucking every last bit of feeling from the steering wheel in modern cars, going to a motorcycle is like taking off thick wool gloves. Every bit of the road is communicated to you. No pebble goes unnoticed, and you have a greater involvement with the ride. Cornering is a whole new experience. You are not a passenger, but one with the curve. You lean with the bike to keep it balanced, not just sit and let it take the corner. With no covering, every bit of the elements is known. Dust and rain drops feel like needles to unprotected portions of the body, and smells, good or bad, are not masked by the air intake of a car. Along with the feelings come the sounds.</p>

          <p>Sound is a large aspect of motorcycling. In a big V-twin, the exhaust note is deep and powerful. You can feel it in your chest. The engine has its symphonic cacophony of valve clicks, combustion cycles, and intake whooshes that produce an almost awe inspiring effect from the marvel of engineering and showmanship that it is. It communicates by sound. If mistreated, it sputters and coughs violently, scolding you for whatever wrongdoing was done. When in poor health, odd sounds not normally present come forward to let you know it needs help. You can tell when it’s overworked by its screaming and violent shaking desperately trying to tell you to upshift or let off the throttle. Every bit of noise involves you more with the motorcycle and keeps you immersed in the experience.</p>

          <p>Motorcycle riding is a joy for those who want a deep involvement in the journey from location to location. The sights, sounds, and feelings pull you into the moment and make you think about the ride. In comparison to even a convertible, the motorcycle experience engulfs you in the feeling of the ride like no other and is truly unique and awe inspiring.</p>
