          <h2>New Networking Hardware</h2>
          <p>Picked up a 50 port POE switch and two Dell dual 10Gb network cards from a swap meet. I don't have pictures of the network cards, but they're Dell model Y40PH. The switch is a Cisco SG200-50P and will be a good upgrade to my existing consumer switch, and the addition of POE will let me run cool IOT stuff or just experiment with it.</p>

          <h2>Changing Direction</h2>
          <p>Over the last month, I have come to the realization that computer science and software development are not for me. Programming as a hobby and homelab tinkering are still fun and a good challenge, but working as a developer maintaining crazy code bases or not being able to fix the old, horrible mistakes made in the previous server deployment as a sysadmin has become unapealing. Instead, I plan to pursue transportation and automotive design. I am much happier drawing, using CAD, and learning about digital art, so changing to an art school should allow me to pursue those skills while letting me to keep comupters as a hobby. Product design in general is something I enjoy and vehicles specifically are probably my favorite objects to work with, so a major in transportation design with a focus on autos makes the most sense at the moment to me.</p>
          <p>Currently, I am applying to the College for Creative Studies (CCS) in Detroit, Michigan and will keep my acceptance status up to date here.</p>

          <h2>SL 350 Project</h2>
          <p>I've been into designing motorcycles recently and have gained a bit more appreciation for "bobber" and "chopper" motorcycles.</p>
          <p>There is a badly rusted Honda SL 350 with a seized engine at my house that I want to do something with. I figure it would be a decent "large-scale" project because the bike can't get much worse than it already is if something goes wrong.</p>
          <p>In the concept sketch, I have the rear chopped and replaced by a custom swing arm with a mono shock, and the seat and bike are lowered a few inches. The wheels, frame, front steering and suspension, and the fuel tank are all stock. The handle bars might come from the XS project because I want a modern dirt bike bar on that instead, and they are just a straight bar with a slight pull-back.</p>

          <h2>Non-PSA PSA About Best Buy Seagate Drives</h2>
          <p><b>TLDR: Seagate ST2000DMA08 drives contain/are the same as ST2000MD008 drives.</b></p>
          <p>There may be a site that has already covered this topic, but I couldn't find it during my search, so I figured that I would post about it here.</p>
          <p>So, I'm currently building up a NAS/remote storage system, and I needed some relatively inexpensive CMR drives to install in my server. I ended up finding these <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/seagate-barracuda-2tb-internal-sata-hard-drive-for-desktops/6344172.p?skuId=6344172">Seagate St2000DMA08 drives on BestBuy.com</a>. That particular model number was not on this <a href="https://www.truenas.com/community/resources/list-of-known-smr-drives.141/#:~:text=List%20of%20SMR%20drives%20known%20to%20the%20community%3A,EFRX%20is%20CMR%20%2029%20more%20rows%20">list of known SMR drives</a> from TrueNAS, so I took a gamble and bought them. When I did, I neglected to check the numbers on the box. The box model was ST2000DMA08, but there was a "contains" label that showed that there was an ST2000DM008 drive inside which was on the list of SMR drives. I understand that there are business benefits from making a new model number for a retail store, but it would be nice if Best Buy disclosed this information on their product post. Looking back, the only place that there is a reference to the ST2000DM008 model number is in a picture from a user review.</p>
          <p>I ended up returning them and swapping for these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071RM2HS7?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1">WD Purple WD20PURZ</a> drives because they were the only 2TB CMR drives under $70 that I could find on Amazon or Best Buy (I have some gift cards). Hopefully they work well enough for bulk storage over the network. I'll post more about the installation as the parts come in.</p>

          <h2>Getting Back Into Watercolor</h2>
          <p>After about 7 years since my last watercolor project, I am trying to get back into painting in watercolor. I found a technique online for making deciduous trees, and these are my two practice attempts. The rightmost result is one that I am prouder of, but I still need a lot of work. Prepping the paper is also a skill I need to work on, as the warped paper made painting more difficult.</p>

          <p>Happy New Year!!! (a bit late, I know)</p>
          <h3>Quick Site Update:</h3>
          <p>Mobile view has been improved to the point that I am happy. Some things, like the in-page navigation links, still need addressing, but I have a site-overhaul in mind, so I will not be fixing that on this current site iteration.</p>
          <p>New site plans include the addition of client-side JavaScript and a new page layout that takes advantage of the added functionality. Server-side scripting will eventually happen, but I want to get client-side done first, as it has a more noticeable impact on the reader.</p>
          <p>My computer reviews page is also on hold for the time being. School work and the new site overhaul are taking up most of my time at the moment, but I will have something posted in regard to that by the end of the month.</p>

          <p>My first post will be on my main laptop, a Lenovo ThinkPad T460s from 2016. It has served me well, and since I have had the most time with it recently, I figure it will make a good starting point.</p>
